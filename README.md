# Trail Tracker

Trail Tracker is a website that facilitates preparedness for hikers by giving them important information about trails they are considering traveling. The website interacts with a database which stores Reports prepared by Users who have hiked one or more trails. These Reports, which collectively, can detail the approximately 9,720 miles of trails in Oregon, will be available for prospective hikers to read. Reports can be about one or more Trails a User has hiked on a trip and detail the hikerâ€™s experience while traveling Trails, the conditions of Trails, and what other hikers can expect to encounter while on Trails. Other Users can make Comments on a report to start a discussion or ask a question to the original poster. The site will hopefully grow to thousands of Users contributing frequent trail Reports so the current trail conditions are available to the public.

## Functionality
The website communicates with a database that stores users, trails, reports, and comments. From the website interface, data in the database can be created, read, updated, and deleted.
